# CSIR-NPL-PID-Control-System

This Python-based project implements a real-time PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control system for regulating pressure using multiple Alicat mass flow controllers (MFCs) and a Ruska pressure controller. It features live PID tuning via a simple GUI, continuous data logging to Excel, and live visualization of pressure response.
